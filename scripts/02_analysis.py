# Pseudocode for 02_analysis.py
# Purpose: Analyze the simulation results statistically.

# Import necessary libraries
# Define a function to load simulation data:
    # Accept file path as input
    # Load the data into a list and return it

# Define a function to compute basic statistics:
    # Accept data as input
    # Compute mean, median, standard deviation, max, and min
    # Return the statistics as a dictionary

# Define a function to generate a histogram:
    # Accept data and output path as inputs
    # Plot a histogram of the data and save the figure

# Main script logic:
    # Set the input file path and output directory
    # Load the simulation data
    # Compute statistics
    # Print or save statistics
    # Generate and save a histogram
